INSTALL for LuaGL on Linux

  Download the pre-compile binaries, usually "luagl-X.X_Linux26g4_lib.tar.gz" or "luagl-X.X_Linux26g4_64_lib.tar.gz".
  
  Create a folder and unpack the files:
  
    mkdir luagl
    cd luagl
    tar -xpvzf ../luagl-X.X_Linux26g4_lib.tar.gz
  
  To install the run time libraries (dynamic libraries), run the "install" script.
  
  To install the development files (includes and static libraries), run the "install_dev" script.
  
  To configure the run time libraries as Lua modules, run the "config_lua_module" script. This needs to be used only if the Lua modules have 51/52/.. suffixes. The script is pre-configured for Lua 5.1, to use it for other Lua versions define USE_LUA52=Yes, or USE_LUA53=Yes.
  
  All scripts don't need parameters. They need root privileges.

  For complete information, visit LuaGL's web site at http://luagl.sourceforge.net
  or access its documentation in the HTML folder.
